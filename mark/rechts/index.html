                    It's hard to act coy and try
                  to shy around everything I    
      actually want to say to try               
                  and stay vague in hopes that  
      no one tries to delve deeper              
into my psyche and attempt                      
                 to break open the shell I've   
                     put around myself like look
       there's reasons I don't want             
    to talk to you directly god
